# newADUserScript

A script that adds a new AD user, sets the DisplayName, GivenName, Surname, AccountName, UserPrincipalName, EmailAddress, Description, JobTitle, Address, Postcode, Country, Security Groups and so on.

If you want to use it yourself, you will have to modify some of the parameters. I tried to explain as much as possible through the comments, have a read and you should find it fairly self-explanatory.
