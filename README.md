# New AD User

A script that adds a new AD user, sets the _DisplayName_, _GivenName_, _Surname_, _AccountName_, _UserPrincipalName_, _EmailAddress_, _Description_, _JobTitle_, _Address_, _Postcode_, _Country_, Security Groups and so on.

If you want to use it yourself, you will have to modify some of the parameters. I tried to explain as much as possible through the comments, have a read and you should find it fairly self-explanatory.

Download and save _newUserScript.ps1_, and modify. You may need to run the script in an elevated Powershell window.
